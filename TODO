  Editor:
    Probably break the editor into two parts, 1 for to create the "zones" and 1 for to create the other objects.


    The editor could probably be usefull for other games as well depending.
    Right now the basic planned function of the editor
    1. Take in a sprite sheet.
    2. have the ability to select a sprite from the sheet.
      -- Multiple sprites can be selected at once?
    3. create a create a object with the sprite. 
        -- the editor will have a list of objects that can be created.
        -- this list will be populated by the game.
    4. depending on the object we will be able to select it's properties.

  Game:
    the game will be made up of "zones"
    each zone will be responsible for -
      knowing what entities are in it and were they are.
      knowing the tile map.
      knowing how to get to linked zones.
